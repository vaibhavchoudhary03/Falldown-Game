# Falldown-Game
This project consisted of writing code to recreate the famous computer game "Falldown". My code, Falldown.py, utilizes
uvage.py (the original work of Luther Tychonievich), to import variables and conditionals. In my code, I implemented these variables and triggered the conditionals alongside function writing in order to create a functional and smooth iteration of Falldown. The pdf version of my code, Falldown.pdf, is also available.
